I do not wish to talk to stone or living deads but here I am.
--- Your EXISTENCE means nothing to me so as your love, respect, hate or ego. ---
--- Your Aura resembles your true nature, no matter how much you fake. You can never deny your aura. ---
:winter2019surprisedsnowman:The circle of my world has given me a name .Known by many but knows few ,acknowledges everything and seeks answer yet forgets what was enlightened .Seeks the reason to live/die for but never gets a perfect one .Eager to be awakened but fears the upcoming results. Ready to be sacrificed but questions alot about worthiness. Your vision and perspective might be different but if you think you know me I may not be the one who you think I am. Simply understand that I'm just a parasite like you.

Whatever you are seeking, there is nothing new to be found. There is no purpose or meaning to any of these things. Life was suppose to end when greed, fear, hate and lust gets acknowledged then forgotten. These are the only main reason that is giving life an existence. It is impossible for humans to behave without those feelings so there is no end to the life. It will keep on happening. Almost trapped inside this Maya chakra. Now, what I see these days is hatred getting passed from one men to another. Humans mind are easy to manipulate so they are easily taught to hate. For no legit reason they keeps on hating one another. Some random guy shows their hate, and without second thought we accept to learn their hate. This hate keeps on spreading to every normal human beings. But we must never forget that what learnt can be unlearnt. There is still a hope that hatred might get erased but that will come will a price.
Update: There are some particular things you can never understand no matter how hard you try but that's okay. There is fish and there is cow. :LewdVirus:
