//Just copy the listed commands into your autoexec.cfg file. This is how they work:

//Keeping F5 pressed while watching a demo will automatically forward the demo at a 3x speed. Release F5 and you will be again at normal 1x speed.

//Keeping F6 pressed while watching a demo will automatically forward the demo at a 10x speed. Release F6 and you will be again at normal 1x speed.

//Press F7 once will automatically Pause the demo. Press F7 again to unpause.

//If for any reason your need the DemoUI, press F8.

//Pressing F10 will automatically bring you to your CSGO Home screen (Works also during normales matches, so be careful)

//I hope that will make your experience a little bit easier!

//Edit: I couldnt find any commands for skipping rounds (I think that functions with tickhighlights, but Im not 100% sure) or toggling the DemoUI, so If anyaone knows them, please let me know :D
